This map was made from location data in the [WIRED article by Dhruv Mehrotra and Joey Scott](https://www.wired.com/story/shotspotter-secret-sensor-locations-leak). The map in the article does not allow you to zoom in far enough to easily locate buildings, but this one does.  Now you can see exactly where these expensive surveillance microphones are.
